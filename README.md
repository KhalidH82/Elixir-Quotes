# Elixir-Quotes

This mini group project was a weekend challenge to learn a new technology that we didn't cover in class and build a CRUD application with it. My group decided to learn Elixer and Phoenix which was very similar to working with Ruby on Rails. The app we built is called Quoter and has user authentication built in where users are able perform CRUD functionality on quotes.
