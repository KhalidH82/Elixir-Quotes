<h1>Quoter ELixer/Phoenix</h1>
<img src="./screen.png">

This mini group project was a weekend challenge to learn a new technology that we didn't cover in class and build a CRUD application with it. My group decided to learn Elixer and Phoenix which was very similar to working with Ruby on Rails. The app we built is called Quoter and has user authentication built in where users are able perform CRUD functionality on quotes. To view presentation notes please refer to the Elixer Presentation.key.


<h2>Instructions for Use</h2>

Fork or clone repository to your local machine. Install Phoenix and Elixer and follow instructions below.


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
